# Summary  
In the our research article, we investigated the performance of
machine learning approaches on XRD datasets. The machine
learning models had to classify crystal systems of materials.
Instead of utilizing the tabular data format, the study employed
two types of datasets[rendered images]: graphical and pixelated
image datasets. The images datasets performed very
well as compared to the XRD tabular format dataset used
by other researchers in their previous studies. By training
on the images dataset(graphical and pixelated images) our
machine learning models were able to classify the crystal
system of material with 98% accuracy while testing them
on an unseen dataset.
# Application
This technique can be used in any large data set and implemented on CNN to increase the accuracy compared to statistical models.
# Advantages
Because CNN and other neural networks work well on images rather than CSV file base data, so itâ€™s a good approach to go with, for better model accuracy.

# Convertion of tabluar data into images(a) and graphs(b) 
Tablular data single rwo would be look like this after transforming into images and graphs.
