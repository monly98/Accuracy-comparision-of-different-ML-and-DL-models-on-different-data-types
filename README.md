Summary  
I was exploring a research paper that had findings of a material property prediction. In the article, they used CSV data of over two million samples and report an accuracy of around 83% with different models. My idea was to take the same data and convert it into images and apply different models which increase the accuracy significantly up to 90% with the only use of ten thousand samples.My motivation was to implement CNN because it does a good job on image classification.
This technique can be used in any large data set and implemented on CNN to increase the accuracy compared to statistical models.
Because CNN and other neural networks work well on images rather than CSV file base data, so itâ€™s a good approach to go with, for better model accuracy.
